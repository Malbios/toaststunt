  # NOTE: each `wait.value` below runs *after* the corresponding stream is

  # writes enough output to fill the pipe's OS buffer before exiting, it
  # blocks on its own write() while we block on wait.value, and neither
  # side ever proceeds. readlines blocking until EOF (i.e. until the child
  # closes the pipe, which happens at or before exit) gives the same
  # synchronization safely.

  # BiFuncCallSuspend1.db is stored at "Format Version 17" (DBV_Bool),
  # predating the DBV_BiFuncId16 bump that widened OP_BI_FUNC_CALL's
  # bytecode operand from 1 to 2 bytes. Its #0:server_started() forks a
  # task to shut the server down immediately, while the main task suspends
  # (a builtin call) for 1 real second - so the checkpoint below captures a
  # task genuinely paused mid-BI_FUNC_CALL, with its pc a raw byte offset
  # into 1-byte-operand bytecode. Reloading it forces write_activ/read_activ
  # to recompile that same verb source and reapply the stored pc against
  # the freshly generated bytecode; this only lines up correctly if the
  # operand width is derived from the *reloaded program's own* recorded
  # version rather than from the live (now on this build, 65535-capable)
  # builtin table. See bi_func_id_bytes() in functions.cc.
  #
  # Every dump() stamps its *file header* with current_db_version regardless
  # of what version it was loaded at, but each suspended activation carries
  # its own "language version" tag (write_activ/read_activ) recorded at the
  # moment it originally suspended - so the first reload (phase 2) still
  # decodes the pc as 1-byte-wide, matching how it was originally compiled.
  # Once that first suspended task resumes and finishes, nothing is left
  # suspended in the phase-2 dump; server_started() forks+suspends again on
  # the next boot exactly as phase 1 did, but this time the verb recompiles
  # under the file's now-current version (DBV_BiFuncId16), giving phases 3-4
  # the same round trip through the *new* 2-byte-wide encoding.
